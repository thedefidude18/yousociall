# Community forum following an upvote based ranking algorithm

This discussion forum template is ranking posts shared by community member based on time weighted upvotes. It's built on an Open Social Protocol named [Orbis](https://useorbis.com/) data-ownership while making sure developers won't rely on a centralized entity / database to host their data.

## Getting Started

To get started developers should start by creating their `project` and `context` using the [Orbis Dashboard](https://useorbis.com/dashboard). The ID of the context created should be used in `_app.js`.

## Styles

Most of the colors can be updated in the `styles/global.css` file which contains CSS variables applied to the main `html` property.

## Running locally

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
